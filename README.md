# Wasteland Mod
The classic Minecraft Wasteland mod for 1.7.10

---

This is a forked repository of original wasteland 1.4.4 by **GiMoe**

This mod is an updated version and maintained! Some new building designs were taken and modified from the [Huge Abandoned City map](http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/minecraft-cinematic---huge-abandoned-city/)

**Important:** If you are upgrading the mod in your current play-through, make sure to delete the old config files then disable the spawn bunker. This mod required to have JNBT Library. It's already in repository.

Basics:

This mod is meant to make minecraft survival much harder. You wake up in an underground shelter and just like in a 'real' apocalypse:

1. Food and water is scarce
1. Barren surface - no grass or flowers
1. All trees are 'dead' - no leaves
1. Dry wasteland - no oceans or rivers
1. Ruined houses
1. Abandoned villages
1. Special (slow) zombies spawn during daytime
1. Disable sleeping through the night (don't worry, its all configurable)

Starting out, you may find that this settings may be too difficult (good chest loot is rare, and ruins/villages are rare). Please change the rarity and other options in the config files, I tried to include as many options as possible. If you want configs for something in particular, let me know.
